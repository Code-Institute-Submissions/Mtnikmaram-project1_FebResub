# bugs
I find some bugs in my code :
* The most bug was using space in my file names of the images : so  i double check the codes 
* I have forgotten to creat asset folder : this part was told from the mentor
* The nav bar was not in the write color : I changed the color and the position
* The display was not in form : I search the web to fix the issue
