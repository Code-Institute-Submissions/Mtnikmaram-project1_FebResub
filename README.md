## bugs

I find some bugs in my code :
* The most bug was using space in my file names of the images : so  i double check the codes 
* I have forgotten to creat asset folder : this part was told from the mentor
* The nav bar was not in the write color : I changed the color and the position
* The display was not in form : I search the web to fix the issue

## credits
* The font came from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
* The icons came from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).
* The form validation idea came from a [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNcJuPIZ2WE).

The contect of the the site and the iamges is from [gsmarena](https://gsmarena.com/) but i styled it my self 
I have got some ideas from love running and coffee coders project but i tried to write the codes by myself.
